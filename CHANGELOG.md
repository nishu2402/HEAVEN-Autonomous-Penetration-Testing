## [Unreleased]

### Changed — web UI redesign (premium "hybrid" theme)

- **Complete React UI overhaul** — replaced the green-on-black CRT/matrix
  aesthetic with a modern, professional dark theme: deep-slate surfaces,
  aurora-gradient backdrop, glassmorphism, a violet→blue primary accent
  with emerald kept as the live/signature colour, **Inter** for UI text +
  **JetBrains Mono** for data/code, layered elevation, and framer-motion.
- **Rebuilt design system** (`heaven-ui/src/index.css`) around the same
  class vocabulary, so all 19 pages re-theme consistently. Flagship
  surfaces hand-built: split-hero **LoginPage**, **Dashboard** (gradient
  stat cards + real severity-distribution chart), **Sidebar**/**Header**;
  3D topology reskinned to the new palette.
- **Verified live** — server-rendered screenshots of Login, Dashboard,
  Findings and Scans against a seeded engagement confirm real data flow.
- **Code-splitting** — the heavy three.js 3D topology (~900 KB) is now
  lazy-loaded behind a dynamic import, and every authenticated page is its
  own chunk (`React.lazy` + `Suspense`). First-load JS dropped from a single
  ~1.1 MB bundle to ~313 KB (login + shell); the 3D engine only downloads
  when the Dashboard opens. Removed dead `recharts`/`mermaid` manual chunks.

### Fixed — functional reliability (no fake/stub behaviour)

- **Exploit-DB product search** — added `search_product(service, version)`
  to `vulnscan/exploitdb_client.py` (searchsploit + CSV-mirror free-text
  search). The recon agent's `_tool_correlate_exploit` now returns **real**
  PoC matches instead of an empty placeholder; honest empty result when no
  source is available.
- **Honeypot orchestrator phase** — `recon/honeypot_detector.check_honeypots`
  no longer returns hardcoded zeros; it runs the real `analyze_host` over
  the network scan's discovered hosts and reports genuine counts (wired via
  an orchestrator closure that reads the network task result).
- **Honeypot detection calibration** — a known honeypot-software banner
  (cowrie/kippo/…) now flags on its own; the weighted composite capped
  banner signal at ~0.28 (below the 0.5 threshold), so definitive matches
  went undetected. Added a score floor on signature match.
- **8 new regression tests** (`tests/test_honeypot_and_exploitdb.py`).
  Suite now **313 passed, 1 skipped**.

### Fixed — CI / packaging

- **`pyproject.toml` dependencies block** had drifted under `[project.urls]`,
  so setuptools parsed it as `project.urls.dependencies` and every
  `pip install -e .` aborted — breaking the test, mypy, self-audit and
  docker CI jobs. Moved it back under `[project]`.
- **Wheel data files** — added `[tool.setuptools.package-data]` so SAST
  rulesets (`vulnscan/sast_rules/*.yml`) and `db/schema.sql` ship in the
  wheel; tightened `packages.find` to exclude `heaven-ui`.
- **Dockerfile** — aligned the py-builder workdir with the runtime path
  (`/build` → `/app`) so the editable-install finder resolves after COPY
  (image built fine but crashed on startup before). Added **`.dockerignore`**
  (keeps host venv / node_modules / `data/` / secrets out of the context)
  and a **CI smoke-test** that runs the built image (`heaven --version`).
- **GitHub Actions** — bumped all Node-20 actions to current majors
  (checkout@v5, setup-python@v6, upload/download-artifact@v5, buildx@v4,
  build-push@v7, …), clearing the deprecation warnings.

### Verified

- **NVD model** (`NVD_model.pkl`) confirmed a genuinely trained 13-feature
  ExtraTreesRegressor (R²=0.9925) — discriminates critical→10.0 / low→2.35,
  top features = Integrity/Confidentiality/Availability impact. Not a stub.
- **CLI ↔ webapp parity** — every operational CLI command maps to a UI
  surface; all 35 `api.js` helpers map to real server routes.

### Added — publication-readiness sprint

- **PyPI release workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) — on `v*`
  tags, builds sdist+wheel, verifies install, publishes via PyPI OIDC
  trusted publishing, and cuts a GitHub Release with CHANGELOG body.
- **Docker GHCR build+push workflow** (`.github/workflows/docker.yml`) —
  multi-arch (amd64 + arm64) image at `ghcr.io/nishu2402/heaven` on
  branch push, semver tags on `v*` tags.
- **`heaven init`** — interactive first-time-setup wizard. Generates
  strong passwords, prompts for optional LLM / SIEM / ticketing keys,
  writes a versioned `.env`. Idempotent.
- **`heaven update`** — refreshes Nuclei templates, NVD CVE delta, and
  ExploitDB CSV mirror in one command. Useful for cron / pre-engagement.
- **`heaven scan --watch-tail`** — headless mode that disables the Rich
  live HUD and streams flat one-line-per-event output. For CI / ssh /
  `tee scan.log` workflows where the live HUD scrambles the recording.
- **Asset-criticality risk multiplier** — `heaven scope add --criticality
  {low,medium,high,crown_jewel}` adjusts every finding's `risk_score` by
  the configured multiplier (0.7 / 1.0 / 1.3 / 1.5). 11 new tests.
- **Helm chart** (`deploy/helm/heaven/`) — standard chart with
  Deployment + Service + Secret + ConfigMap + PVC + Ingress (opt-in)
  + ServiceAccount + NOTES.txt. Multi-arch image-ready.
- **`docs/QUICKSTART.md`** — 5-minute walkthrough for evaluators.
- **`docs/COMPARISON.md`** — feature parity matrix vs Burp / ZAP /
  sqlmap / Nessus / Acunetix + empirical-numbers template.
- **`docs/DEMO.md`** — asciinema/video recording script (substitute
  for an actual recorded demo this session).
- **`docs/BENCHMARK_HOWTO.md`** — step-by-step to produce real DVWA
  precision/recall numbers (substitute for the actual benchmark run).
- **Live CI badges** in README — replaces the manually-maintained
  `Tests-294_Passing` badge with the actual GitHub Actions status,
  benchmark workflow status, and PyPI version badges.
- **`pyproject.toml` metadata polish** — full PyPI classifier set,
  project URLs, marketing description, additional keywords. Renamed
  the published package from `heaven` (squatted) to `heaven-pentest`.

### Added — publication push

- **Continuous monitoring** (`heaven watch`) — interval+jitter loop with
  auto-diff against the previous scan. Fires alerts ONLY on `new` or
  `regressed` findings (configurable `--heartbeat` to alert every run).
  Optional `--auto-tickets` to create Jira / Linear issues on regressions.
- **Differential scanning** (`heaven diff <base> <current>`) — bucketed
  output (new / resolved / regressed / unchanged) with CI-friendly exit
  codes. API: `GET /api/scans/{id}/diff?baseline=...`.
- **SAST** (`heaven sast`) — Semgrep wrapper with a curated 18-rule pack
  for Python / JavaScript / Go covering OWASP Top 10. Findings land in
  the engagement DB alongside DAST findings.
- **Ticketing** (`heaven tickets`) — Jira (REST v3) + Linear (GraphQL)
  with auto-priority mapping, label normalisation, and bulk push.
- **Iterative autonomous loop** (`heaven autonomous`) — LLM-driven
  observe → plan → act loop bounded by `--max-iterations` and
  `--time-budget`. Falls back to a deterministic rule-based playbook
  when no LLM API key is set.
- **Coverage grader** (`heaven coverage`) — rule-based OWASP coverage %
  + scope hit rate + optional LLM gap analysis.
- **Lateral movement** (`heaven lateral`) — SSH key reuse + SMB PsExec
  + pass-the-hash with a hop graph output.
- **Knowledge graph** (`heaven knowledge`) — SQLite-backed cross-engagement
  memory of (target_profile, technique, outcome) tuples with Beta-smoothed
  per-technique success priors.
- **Exploit-DB lookup** (`heaven exploitdb <cve>`) — local `searchsploit`
  (preferred) + ExploitDB CSV mirror.
- **AI namespace** — Layers A–E: provider-agnostic LLM gateway
  (Anthropic / OpenAI / Gemini), recon agent, attack-chain planner,
  FP review, autonomous loop.
- **Authenticated scanning** — `--cookie-file PATH` (Netscape format)
  and `--auth url=/login,user=X,pass=Y[,csrf_field=token]` on
  `heaven scan`.
- **Exploit proof** — `heaven/vulnscan/exploit_proof.py` ties sqlmap,
  RCE canary file dropping, and an SSRF callback verifier into a single
  `prove_finding()` entry point. Auto-triggered with `--auto-prove` on
  `heaven scan`.
- **Post-exploitation** — `heaven/postex/` with `linpeas_runner`,
  `bloodhound_collector`, `cred_validator`. Admin-gated.
- **Benchmark suite** — `tests/benchmarks/` against DVWA with adapters
  for Burp / ZAP / sqlmap, scanner-agnostic metrics, markdown + CSV
  reporters, GitHub Actions weekly workflow.
- **Methodology mapping docs** — `docs/methodology/` with explicit
  mappings to OWASP Testing Guide v4, NIST SP 800-115, and PTES.
- **NVD model card** — `data/models/NVD_model.MODEL_CARD.md` following
  Google's Model Cards format.
- **Reproducibility** — `--seed` flag on `heaven scan` + `heaven replay
  <scan-id>` for deterministic re-execution.
- **SIEM forwarders** — `SplunkHECAlerter` + `ElasticAlerter` in
  `devsecops/alerting.py`.
- **Web UI pages** — Watch, ScanDiff, SAST, Autonomous, AIPlans,
  Coverage, Postex, Lateral, Knowledge, Tickets, Benchmark, Methodology.

### Changed

- **CLI split** — `heaven/main.py` decomposed from a 1380-line monolith
  into a thin shim plus `heaven/cli/` subpackage (one module per command
  group). The `heaven = heaven.main:cli` pyproject entry point is unchanged.
- **`zeroday_engine.py` → `anomaly_probe.py`** — renamed to match what
  the code actually does (behavioural fuzzing heuristics, not real
  zero-day discovery).
- **`ai_brain.py` priors** moved from hardcoded module constants into
  `data/models/priors_bootstrap.json`. `heaven/ml/train_priors.py` +
  `heaven train-priors` produce `priors_learned.json` from engagement
  history, which is preferred at runtime when present.

### Fixed

- Several mypy strict-mode issues across the new modules.
- Ruff E731 (lambda-assignment) + F401 (unused imports) across the
  AI layer.
